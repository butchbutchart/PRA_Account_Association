# PRA_Account_Association
Links vault accounts and Remote RDP jump items of the same name.

Will fail if the account has been configured to have any associations already, this only works for Remote RDP Jump Items, but could be modified to do Shell Jumps etc.

Useful when domain accounts are used on a 1:1 basis
